As You Call, So It Echoes

It was a hot sunny day.

Irishka was jumping rope, and Lenya was watching. Irishka jumped and jumped, and then she tripped - probably because it was so hot.

"You tripped, you tripped!" Lenya shouted. Irishka felt hurt, so she said:

"Come on, I'll show you something..."

The children ran under the archway that was in their building. They ran up, stopped. Irishka got ready and shouted:

"Ahhh!" - short like that: "Ahhh!"

And from above, someone called back:

"Ah!" - a little quieter, but in Irishka's voice.

"Who's that?" asked Lenya.

"Echo."

"Ahhh!" - Lenya shouted just as loudly and sharply.

"What are you yelling about here?"

The children turned around and saw Uncle Misha, an old man with a wide beard, like in the old days.

Uncle Misha was known in the courtyard as an avid fisherman. His voice was gruff, but his face was kind.

"It's not us yelling," said Lenya. "Echo is sitting up there. It's the one yelling."

"Ahhh!" Uncle Misha shouted, and from above, echo replied in Uncle Misha's voice:

"Ah!"

"Is that really an echo?" said Uncle Misha. "Well, tell Tanya to let you come fishing with me, and I'll show you a real echo!"

Tanya let them go. Not right away, of course...

It was cooler by the river than in the city, and so everyone's mood was more cheerful. Uncle Misha set up his fishing rods and was already getting ready to doze off, as all fishermen do.

"Where's the little old man?" asked Lenya.

Uncle Misha even flinched:

"What little old man?"

"Well, the one who's Echo."

"Oh, the echo," Uncle Misha remembered. "Ahhh!"

Uncle Misha shouted, but no one answered back, no matter how hard the children listened. Lenya was about to ask again about the Echo old man, when suddenly from far away someone answered in Uncle Misha's voice:

"Ah!"

"Why is he answering from over there?" Lenya wondered.

"Oh, you don't know anything," said Irishka. She took a stone and threw it into the water. The stone splashed, and from it, waves spread out in circles in all directions. The waves reached the shore and began bouncing back in the opposite direction.

You've probably already guessed that waves on water and sound in air are somewhat similar to each other.

Lenya understood this too.

"When I shout," he said, "the air starts to vibrate. This vibration spreads out in all directions. It runs to the shore, hits it, and comes back, right into my ear."

"That's right," said Uncle Misha. "And here you were talking about a little old man!"

"I was just joking about the old man because I didn't know," Lenya replied.
