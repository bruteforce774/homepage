As You Call, So It Echoes

It was a hot sunny day.

Irishka was jumping rope, and Lenya was watching. Irishka jumped and jumped, and then she tripped - probably because it was so hot.

"You tripped, you tripped!" Lenya shouted. Irishka felt hurt, so she said:

"Come on, I'll show you something..."

The children ran under the archway that was in their building. They ran up, stopped. Irishka got ready and shouted:

"Ahhh!" - short like that: "Ahhh!"

And from above, someone called back:

"Ah!" - a little quieter, but in Irishka's voice.

"Who's that?" asked Lenya.

"Echo."

"Ahhh!" - Lenya shouted just as loudly and sharply.

"What are you yelling about here?"

The children turned around and saw Uncle Misha, an old man with a wide beard, like in the old days.
