      I have a <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774">Github</a> which
      features my coding projects. If you're into programming languages, the
      <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774/simula">GNU Simula compiler</a>
      is preserved there. It hasn't been maintained for ages, but it will
      compile on a modern Linux system (instructions in the repo).

      Simula was developed by Norwegian computer scientists and is particularly
      noteworthy for introducing object-oriented programming. The University of
      Oslo has
      <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/tjenester/it/hjelp/programvare/simula/"
        >some useful information and software</a
      >. I also have a
      <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774/simula-code">
        repo with some typed in textbook code</a
      >. The code does compile as late as 2025. There is also a
      <a
        href="https://www.mn.uio.no/tjenester/it/hjelp/programvare/simula/implementation/portable-simula-revisited/"
        >Simula compiler implemented in Java.</a

      I wrote this <a href="https://bruteforce774.github.io/conway">simulation</a> of Conway's Game of Life. It is implemented in "vanilla" (frameworkless) JavaScript.

      I am always interested in learning languages. Before starting a career in
      tech I was intending to work as a linguist. While languages of interest
      are too many to list, I studied Russian at university. I am currently
      doing some translation work <a href="russian">here</a>.
