    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p text align="left">
      I have a <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774">Github</a> which features my coding projects.
      If you're into programming languages, the <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774/simula">GNU Simula compiler</a>
      is preserved there. It hasn't been maintained for ages, but it will compile on a modern Linux system (instructions in the repo).

      Simula was developed by Norwegian computer scientists and is particularly noteworthy for introducing object-oriented programming. The University of Oslo
      has <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/tjenester/it/hjelp/programvare/simula/">some useful information and software</a>.
      I also have a <a href="https://github.com/bruteforce774/simula-code"> repo with some typed in textbook code</a>. The code does compile as late as 2025.
      There is also a <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/tjenester/it/hjelp/programvare/simula/implementation/portable-simula-revisited/">Simula compiler implemented in Java.</a>

      I am always interested in learning languages. Before starting a career in tech I was intending to work as a linguist. While languages of interest are
      too many to list, I studied Russian at university. I am currently doing some translation work <a href="russian">here</a>.
